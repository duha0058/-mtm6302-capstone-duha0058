Capstone Project Name- Bake with Love

Design Choices-The Bake With Love website now looks cozy, sweet, and homemade. Instead of looking like a stiff business site, it uses soft shapes to remind people of fresh baking. We use close-up photos of things like flour and frosting to make visitors feel connected to the food.

Dekstop View:
The Feature section lists Pastry Classes, Custom Orders, and Delivery side-by-side in three columns to make the best use of the screen width. The top Hero section is divided into a split layout (half-and-half).

Mobile/Tablet View:
On mobile devices, the design changes to a simple vertical list. Buttons and cards stretch all the way across the screen, making them big and easy to tap with a thumb. In the top section, we moved the pictures below the headline so the main message ("Bake. Share. Love.") is the very first thing people see.

 Usability and User Experience Improvements:

 Visual Heirarchy: We put different services, like Classes and Orders, into their own separate boxes (cards) with plenty of space in between. This organizes the content so users can quickly skim the page and find exactly what they are looking for.

 Accessibility: The switch from pure black text to dark brown on cream backgrounds provides sufficient contrast for readability while reducing the harsh glare often found in high-contrast black-and-white designs.

 Iconography: We use custom line drawings for each service section. These simple pictures (like a whisk for classes, a cupcake for orders, or an oven for delivery) help users instantly understand what is offered without having to read the text first.
