Design Choices-For the Cosmos project, the visual design shifts from a structural low-fidelity wireframe to a high-fidelity "Dark Mode" aesthetic. The goal was to create an immersive, cinematic experience that mirrors the vastness of space.

Color and Font Selection
color Palette:
Primary: Deep space blue (#05070A)
Secondary: Solar Orange (#FF6B00) AND Nebula Blue (#00C2CB)
Accent: Stark White: (#FFFFFF)

Typography:
Headings: A playful Script FOnt
Body Text: A clean Sans-Serif

Dekstop View:
Utilizes a wide layout with a dedicated "Hero Section" to showcase the Astronomy Picture of the Day. The content below follows a 3-column grid for "Related Topics" and "Image Details," maximizing the use of screen real estate.

Mobile/Tablet View:
The grid adapts to a 2-column layout. The main image remains prominent, while secondary information wraps fluidly to ensure text remains readable without shrinking.

 Usability and User Experience Improvements:

 Visual Heirarchy: The design establishes a clear hierarchy using size and color. The "Today's Image" is the largest element, immediately telling the user what is most important. Secondary data is contained in smaller, uniform cards.

 Accessibility: By using a dark interface, the design reduces the glare often associated with bright white websites, which is particularly helpful for users viewing the site in low-light environments (a common context for astronomy enthusiasts).

 Iconography: The move from a text-heavy wireframe to a visual card layout allows users to quickly scan headers and images to find the content they are interested in, rather than reading long blocks of text.
